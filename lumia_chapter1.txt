Welcome to Lumia AI Financial Analytics Platform - an intelligent investment recommendation system designed to bridge the gap between raw financial data and actionable investment insights. This platform represents a comprehensive approach to modern portfolio management, leveraging cutting-edge technologies in data processing, sentiment analysis, and algorithmic trading to provide personalized investment recommendations.

The Lumia platform addresses the critical challenge faced by modern investors: transforming vast amounts of financial data into meaningful, personalized investment strategies that align with individual risk profiles and growth expectations.

1.1 Background & Motivation

1.1.1 Industry Context
The financial markets have undergone dramatic transformation in the digital age. With over 9 million daily price records across stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies, investors face an unprecedented challenge: how to extract meaningful insights from this vast ocean of data. Traditional investment advisory services often lack the real-time processing capabilities and comprehensive sentiment analysis required for modern market conditions.

Modern financial markets generate enormous volumes of data daily - price movements, trading volumes, news articles, social media sentiment, and fundamental metrics. However, most individual investors lack the technological infrastructure and analytical expertise to process this information effectively. This creates a significant gap between data availability and actionable insights.

1.1.2 Data Explosion vs Insight Gap
While financial data has grown exponentially, the tools for processing and interpreting this information have lagged behind. Individual investors struggle with:

- Information overload from multiple news sources (financial news, social media, company announcements)
- Lack of personalized risk assessment based on individual investment pillars
- Inability to correlate market sentiment with technical indicators in real-time  
- Limited access to institutional-grade analytics and quantitative models
- Fragmented investment platforms lacking end-to-end compatibility
- Static recommendation systems that don't adapt to changing market conditions
- Difficulty in processing multi-asset class data (stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, crypto) simultaneously

The Lumia platform addresses these challenges by providing a unified, AI-driven solution that transforms raw data into personalized investment strategies based on user-defined investment pillars: capital allocation preferences, risk appetite levels, and expected growth expectations.

1.2 Problem Statement

Modern investors require sophisticated analytics that can process multiple data streams simultaneously - from traditional OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) pricing data to real-time news sentiment, social media discussions, and fundamental analysis. The core problems Lumia solves include:

**Data Integration Challenges:**
- Disparate data sources requiring manual correlation and analysis
- Lack of unified time-series database architecture for financial data
- Inconsistent data formats across different asset classes and providers
- Real-time processing limitations with traditional database systems
