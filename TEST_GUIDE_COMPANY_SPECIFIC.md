## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Access the App
Open browser to: http://localhost:8501

and sustainable debt levels

```

```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: App Not Loading
**Solution:** Restart the app:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\mujammil maldar\Desktop\New folder (4)\app\Lumia"
taskkill /F /IM streamlit.exe
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

### Issue 2: Still Seeing "Chart Unavailable"

**Solution:** 
1. Check if portfolio was regenerated AFTER code changes
2. Click "🔄 Generate New Portfolio" to create fresh portfolio
3. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Issue 4: Error When Opening Stock
**Solution:** Check terminal for Python errors. Common issues:
- Import errors (numpy, plotly)
