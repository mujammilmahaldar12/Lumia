CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background

The financial services industry has undergone a profound transformation in recent years, driven by technological advancements and the democratization of investment management. Traditional investment advisory services, once exclusive to high-net-worth individuals, are now being reimagined through algorithmic solutions that make sophisticated portfolio management accessible to retail investors.

The concept of robo-advisory emerged in the early 2010s as a response to the limitations of conventional financial advisory services, which often suffer from high fees, human bias, minimum investment requirements, and limited accessibility. Modern investors, particularly millennials and tech-savvy individuals, demand transparent, cost-effective, and data-driven investment solutions that can adapt to their unique financial circumstances and goals.

The Lumia Robo-Advisor project was conceived to address these market needs by developing a comprehensive, multi-asset investment platform that combines the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory with cutting-edge web technologies. The project leverages quantitative financial modeling, automated data collection, and intelligent portfolio optimization to provide personalized investment recommendations across diverse asset classes including stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies.

The financial technology landscape in India presents significant opportunities for innovation, with increasing digital adoption, growing disposable income, and a young demographic eager to explore investment opportunities. However, the complexity of financial markets, lack of personalized guidance, and fragmented investment platforms create barriers for individual investors seeking optimal portfolio construction.
