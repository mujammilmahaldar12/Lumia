CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background

In the contemporary financial landscape, investment management has become increasingly complex and data-driven. Traditional investment advisory services are often limited by human biases, time constraints, and the inability to process vast amounts of market data efficiently. With the exponential growth of financial markets, the number of investment options has surged, making it challenging for individual investors to make informed decisions.

The LUMIA Investment Management System addresses these challenges by leveraging artificial intelligence, advanced algorithms, and comprehensive market data analysis to provide personalized portfolio recommendations. The system integrates multiple asset classes including stocks, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), mutual funds, bonds, and cryptocurrencies, offering a holistic approach to portfolio diversification.

The global shift towards robo-advisory platforms has demonstrated the effectiveness of algorithmic portfolio management. Studies indicate that AI-powered investment platforms can analyze millions of data points in real-time, identify market trends, and optimize portfolio allocation with minimal human intervention. However, most existing solutions focus on a single asset class or lack comprehensive risk profiling capabilities.

LUMIA distinguishes itself by implementing a sophisticated multi-factor scoring system that evaluates assets based on:
- Fundamental Analysis (30%): Financial health, profitability ratios, growth metrics
- Technical Analysis (40%): Price trends, momentum indicators, volatility measures
- Sentiment Analysis (15%): Market sentiment derived from news and social media
- Advanced Metrics (15%): Risk-adjusted returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown

The system employs Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) principles combined with machine learning techniques to construct optimal portfolios tailored to individual risk profiles and investment horizons. By automating the portfolio construction process, LUMIA democratizes access to sophisticated investment strategies previously available only to high-net-worth individuals.
