### 3. **💡 Professional Technical Commentary**

**Real insights with technical terms, like a professional analyst:**

#### Example Commentary #1: Strong Uptrend
```
✅ Strong Momentum: Stock has gained over 10% in the last month, 
   showing robust buying interest and positive sentiment.

✅ Low Volatility (18.5%): Stable price action, suitable for 
   conservative investors. Lower risk of sudden drawdowns.

✅ Golden Cross Formation: 20-day MA is 3.2% above 50-day MA. 
   Bullish technical setup.

✅ Above Moving Average: Trading 5.8% above 20-day MA. Bulls in control.

✅ High Volume: Above-average trading activity indicates strong 
   institutional interest.
```

#### Example Commentary #2: Consolidation Phase
```
➖ Neutral Momentum: Price consolidating in tight range, waiting 
   for catalyst for next move.

➖ Moderate Volatility (28.3%): Normal market fluctuations, 
   acceptable for balanced portfolios.

⚠️ Below Moving Average: Trading 2.5% below 20-day MA. Needs to 
   reclaim this level.

⚠️ Low Volume: Thin trading suggests lack of conviction. Wait for 
   volume confirmation.
```

#### Example Commentary #3: Bearish Setup
```
⚠️ Bearish Pressure: Significant decline in recent month. Consider 
   if this is a temporary correction or trend reversal.

⚠️ High Volatility (42.7%): Significant price swings. Requires 
   higher risk tolerance and longer investment horizon.

⚠️ Death Cross Risk: 50-day MA is 4.1% above 20-day MA. Bearish 
   technical pattern.
```

**Technical Terms Used:**
- Moving Averages (SMA 20, SMA 50)
- Golden Cross / Death Cross
- Volatility (Annualized standard deviation)
- Support/Resistance levels
- Volume analysis
- Trend strength
- Momentum indicators

---

### 4. **📅 Historical Performance Context**

**Two-Column Layout:**

**Left Column - Recent Performance:**
```
Recent Performance:
- Last 7 Days: +2.3%
- Last 30 Days: +12.5%
- Last 90 Days: +28.3%
```

**Right Column - Risk Metrics:**
```
Risk Metrics:
- Max Drawdown: -8.5%     ← Largest peak-to-trough decline
- Annualized Volatility: 18.5%
- Current Price: ₹2,450.00
```

**What These Mean:**

**Max Drawdown:**
- <10%: Stable, low risk
- 10-20%: Moderate corrections
- >20%: Significant volatility

**Interpretation Example:**
> "Max drawdown of -8.5% means even in worst period, you would've been down only 8.5%. Shows resilience."

---

### 5. **💼 Fundamental Highlights**

**Three Key Fundamental Metrics:**

#### A. **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ P/E Ratio       │
│   24.5          │
│   🟢 Fair       │ ← Color-coded assessment
└─────────────────┘
```

**Color Logic:**
- 🟢 Green (10-30): Fair valuation
- 🟡 Yellow (30-50): Expensive but acceptable
- 🔴 Red (>50): Very expensive

#### B. **ROE (Return on Equity)**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ ROE             │
│   22.5%         │
│   🟢 Excellent  │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Color Logic:**
- 🟢 Green (>15%): Excellent profitability
- 🟡 Yellow (10-15%): Good
- 🔴 Red (<10%): Weak returns

#### C. **Debt/Equity Ratio**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Debt/Equity     │
│   0.45          │
│   🟢 Low        │
└─────────────────┘
```

**Color Logic:**
- 🟢 Green (<1): Low debt, safe
- 🟡 Yellow (1-2): Moderate leverage
- 🔴 Red (>2): High debt risk

---

### 6. **💡 Fundamental Analysis Commentary**

**Professional fundamental insights:**

#### Example: Strong Fundamentals
```
✅ Fairly Valued: P/E ratio of 24.5 suggests reasonable valuation 
   relative to earnings.

✅ Exceptional Returns: ROE of 22.5% demonstrates excellent capital 
   efficiency and profitability.

✅ Conservative Leverage: D/E ratio of 0.45 indicates low financial 
   risk and strong balance sheet.
```

#### Example: Warning Signs
```
⚠️ Expensive: P/E ratio of 52.3 suggests premium valuation. Justified 
   only if high growth expected.

⚠️ Weak Returns: ROE of 8.2% below industry standards. Management 
   effectiveness questionable.

⚠️ High Leverage: D/E ratio of 2.8 suggests elevated financial risk. 
   Monitor interest coverage.
```

## Technical Implementation

### Function: `display_asset_deep_insights(symbol, pick, db)`

**Location:** `app/streamlit_app.py` (lines 863-1159)

**What It Does:**

1. **Queries Database for Price Data:**
```python
prices = db.query(DailyPrice).filter(
    DailyPrice.symbol == symbol
).order_by(DailyPrice.date.desc()).limit(90).all()
```

2. **Calculates Moving Averages:**
```python
for i in range(len(closes)):
    if i >= 19:
        sma_20.append(sum(closes[i-19:i+1]) / 20)
    if i >= 49:
        sma_50.append(sum(closes[i-49:i+1]) / 50)
```

3. **Calculates Volatility (Standard Deviation):**
```python
returns = [(closes[i] - closes[i-1]) / closes[i-1] for i in range(1, len(closes))]
volatility = np.std(returns) * np.sqrt(252) * 100  # Annualized
```

4. **Determines Trend:**
```python
if current_price > sma_20[-1] > sma_50[-1]:
    trend = "🟢 Strong Uptrend"
elif current_price < sma_20[-1] < sma_50[-1]:
    trend = "🔴 Downtrend"
elif sma_20[-1] > sma_50[-1]:
    trend = "🟡 Bullish Crossover"
```

5. **Generates Professional Commentary:**
```python
if price_change_30d > 10:
    commentary.append("✅ Strong Momentum: Stock has gained over 10%...")
elif volatility < 20:
    commentary.append("✅ Low Volatility: Stable price action...")
```

6. **Queries Fundamental Data:**
```python
fundamental = db.query(QuarterlyFundamental).filter(
    QuarterlyFundamental.symbol == symbol
).order_by(QuarterlyFundamental.quarter_end.desc()).first()
```

7. **Color-Codes Metrics:**
```python
if 10 <= pe_ratio <= 30:
    pe_color = "🟢"  # Fair
elif pe_ratio > 50:
    pe_color = "🔴"  # Expensive
```

## Integration Points

### Modified: Stock Tab Display

**File:** `app/streamlit_app.py` (lines 1404-1429)

**Changes:**

2. Added separator line after reasoning

```python

    # ... existing score display ...
    
    # SHOW DETAILED REASONING
    if 'reasoning' in pick and pick['reasoning']:
        st.markdown("---")
        st.markdown("**🧠 Why This Stock?**")
        st.info(pick['reasoning'])
    
    # NEW: DEEP INSIGHTS WITH CHARTS
    st.markdown("---")
    with st.spinner("Loading deep technical analysis..."):
        try:
            from database import get_db
            db = next(get_db())
            display_asset_deep_insights(pick['symbol'], pick, db)
            db.close()
        except Exception as e:
