```python
class DataValidator:
    """Comprehensive data validation for financial information."""
    
    def validate_price_data(self, data: dict) -> bool:
        """Validate price data integrity and logical consistency."""
        required_fields = ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']
        
        # Check required fields presence
        if not all(field in data for field in required_fields):
            return False
            
        # Validate price relationships
        if not (data['low'] <= data['open'] <= data['high'] and 
                data['low'] <= data['close'] <= data['high']):
            return False
            
        # Validate volume
        if data['volume'] < 0:
            return False
            
        # Check for reasonable price ranges (no negative prices)
        if any(data[field] <= 0 for field in ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close']):
            return False
            
        return True
    
    def validate_signal_quality(self, signals: dict) -> bool:
        """Validate generated signal quality and ranges."""
        validation_rules = {
            'rsi': (0, 100),
            'volatility': (0, 5),  # Max 500% annual volatility
            'momentum_score': (0, 100),
            'trend_strength': (0, 100)
        }
        
        for signal_name, value in signals.items():
            if signal_name in validation_rules:
                min_val, max_val = validation_rules[signal_name]
                if not (min_val <= value <= max_val):
                    logger.warning(f"Signal {signal_name} outside valid range: {value}")
                    return False
